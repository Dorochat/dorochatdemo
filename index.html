      <h1>WhatsApp clone in html5,css3,php and Websocket</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Everyone likes the WhatsApp Private Messaging System where communication has been made easy with amazing features to enhance user experience.</p>

      <p>As a result, we saw the need to design a similar system which is also responsive to screen and uses the latest technologies especially for the higher versions of PHP to make life easier for our good users or clients and the love we have for you guys.</p>

      <p>This amazing social networking system is a user friendly application which is similar to that of WhatsApp with more advance features and functionalities, the system also is very easy to install and customize to suit your needs because we had the users in mind while designing the system.</p>

      <p>The script was supposed to be entirely free of charge because we really love you guys, all we have in our heads we learnt them from here, but recently our office got fire and it was not insured,lucky enough copy of this script was in one of developer's laptop. We're here by offering this script @ <a href="">20$</a> or you can as well as Donate as little as <a href="">15$</a> and download this script, with the support you have given to us will ensure you that  more features and support will be given to you all the time free of charge.You will see the difference when you test or demo the system via the link at the top section of this page. We are proud to inform you that you won't find this kind of system any where on the net except here. We have had previous versions of the Private Messaging System but this one is beyond "special" due to its new features and responsiveness</p>

      <p>Through this System you will learn a lot, and we're here to help you! lets get started</p>
